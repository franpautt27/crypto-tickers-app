## Filter by Name or Id feature
If you want to just go to a specific coin, you can filter all the results by the coin name or Id!

## Warning
When using the filter functionality by name, at first it loads *all* the coin data from the API recursively (since the API is all paginated), for that reason, the loading here takes a really long time. I understand that this is totally a bad practice, so I recommend to the CoinLore team (owners of the Crypto API) to create an endpoint where users can filter by name.
